##### Understanding the Problem
**Objective:**

Build and evaluate deep learning models capable of accurately classifying images of dogs and cats. The goal is to explore both a custom neural network and a transfer learning approach (VGG16) to identify which performs better in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and generalization. This can be extended to other animal image classification tasks and is foundational for real-world image recognition systems.

**Approach:**

We will work with a subset of the Dogs vs Cats dataset consisting of 5,000 labeled images. The project will include:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyze the dataset through visualizations and statistics to understand the distribution and characteristics of the image data.

**Model Training**

Model 1: Train a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Model 2: Fine-tune a VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet using transfer learning.

Model Evaluation
Compare model performance using:
